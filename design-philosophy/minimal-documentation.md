# Minimal Documentation

Most users don't want to read through help docs before they can use your app. Instead, they expect that your app will be intuitive and simple for them to understand without assistance.

## Use Understandable Copy

Avoid technical jargon and assume little-to-no technical knowledge. This lets your app be “self-documenting.”

Provide non-technical explanations instead of cryptic error messages. If something goes wrong, a simplified explanation of what happened and how to fix it should be presented.
